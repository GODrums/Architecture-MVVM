#  MVVM showcase for iOS apps
## Part of the iPraktikum workflow sessions


This app is build for demonstration purposes of the MVVM software design pattern. 
It uses SwiftUI for iOS 16.2 and can be used as basis for all sorts of iOS apps.
The repository features 2 versions of the app, one displays mock data, while the other displays data from an API.

### The Problem Statement

The goal of this app is to display data from an API endpoint as a scrollable list on the screen. Currently (main branch) it is only able to display pre-generated mock data. The second version (solution branch) features the webrequest integration and is successfully able to display the desired data from the API.
